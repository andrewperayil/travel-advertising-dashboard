## üéØ Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of travel advertising effectiveness across different platforms and customer journey stages. Built as an executive dashboard for strategic decision-making, it transforms raw survey data into actionable business insights.

**Context**: Conducted for an Externship with Extern, Expedia to understand how sponsored travel content influences consumer decision-making throughout the travel planning and booking journey.

## üîç Problem Statement

The travel industry invests heavily in digital advertising across multiple platforms, but lacks clear visibility into:

- **Platform effectiveness**: Which channels drive actual conversions vs. just engagement
- **Customer journey impact**: When in the planning process do ads have maximum influence
- **Content optimization**: What types of advertising content resonate most with travelers
- **Conversion gaps**: Why high engagement doesn't always translate to bookings

This dashboard addresses these challenges by providing data-driven answers to strategic advertising questions.
